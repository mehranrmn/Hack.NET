## Overview

Hack.NET is a set of .NET-based projects designed to facilitate learning in security by implementing, exploiting, and mitigating various security vulnerabilities. Through a series of versioned releases, the project demonstrates different bug classes, showcasing the lifecycle from insecure code to exploitation and eventual mitigation.

**Disclaimer**: This project is intended solely for **educational** purposes to demonstrate security vulnerabilities within the .NET framework. The author does **not** assume any responsibility for any misuse of the information provided. Users are advised to utilize this material responsibly and within the bounds of all applicable laws and regulations.

## Security Lifecycle

Hack.NET employs a security lifecycle approach to demonstrate the progression from vulnerable code to secure implementation. Each stage of the lifecycle is marked with a corresponding git tag, following a structured naming convention to indicate the current state:

- **Bugged**: Initial implementation with intentional security vulnerabilities.
- **Proof of Concept (PoC)**: Demonstrates how the vulnerabilities can be exploited.
- **Secured**: Implements security measures to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.

## Projects

Hack.NET currently includes the following project:  
- **FileManagementAPI**: An ASP.NET Core project focused on implementing, exploiting, and mitigating vulnerabilities using file management APIs.
